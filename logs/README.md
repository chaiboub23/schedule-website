# Logs

The logs are in chronological order and are named with the date written.

To read the date of the log, the file name contains 6 digits:

* The first two digits are the day
* The second two digits are the month
* The final two digits are the year

For example, `080421.md` is file written on April 8th, 2021.

Each log has an intro and an exit.

The intro is what I did on that day and the exit is what I planned to do for the next day.
