# Intro
1. Made a flask app that uses python and HTML to make a webserver.
    1. This webserver can talk from frontend to backend and display the schedule and get user input.
    2. All done using flask and HTML, no other libraries other than thosed used before with python.
    3. No more JSON because we can send python arrays straight to JavaScript.
2. Deployed to Heroku to host flask webserver.
    1. Had to make a git repository to push changes to Heroku.
3. App is available @ https://rnsportalv2.herokuapp.com
# Exit
1. Potential bug: Upload sometimes does not work.
2. Frontend UI
